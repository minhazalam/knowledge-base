### Core Concepts

1. **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**
   - **Overview:** ARM is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account.
   - **Features:**
     - Resource grouping

2. **Azure Subscriptions and Resource Groups**
   - **Subscription:** A logical container for Azure resources, used for billing and management purposes.
   - **Resource Group:** A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. Resources in a resource group share the same lifecycle and permissions.

### Data Engineering Best Practices

1. **Data Security and Compliance**
   - Use encryption at rest and in transit.
   - Implement RBAC and managed identities.
   - Regularly audit and monitor access.

2. **Data Integration and ETL/ELT Pipelines**
   - Design scalable and maintainable data pipelines using Azure Data Factory.
   - Optimize data movement and transformation processes.
   - Use Azure Databricks for complex data processing and machine learning workflows.

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize storage by selecting appropriate tiers (e.g., Hot, Cool, Archive for Blob Storage).
   - Tune SQL databases for performance using indexing and partitioning.
   - Use caching and data distribution strategies for Cosmos DB.

4. **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**
   - Utilize Azure Monitor and Application Insights for monitoring resources.
   - Set up alerts for critical metrics and log analytics for detailed insights.
   - Use diagnostic logs and metrics for troubleshooting issues.

5. **Cost Management**
   - Use Azure Cost Management and Billing to track and optimize spending.
   - Choose appropriate pricing tiers and scaling options for services.
   - Implement cost-saving strategies like reserved instances and spot VMs.
